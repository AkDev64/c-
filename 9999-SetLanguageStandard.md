# Definindo a Versão de C++ do compilador gcc

Setting a language standard in GCC/G++/Clang

For GCC/G++/Clang, you can use compiler options -std=c++11, -std=c++14, -std=c++17, -std=c++20, or -std=c++23 (to enable C++11/14/17/20/23 support respectively). If you have GCC 8 or 9, you’ll need to use -std=c++2a for C++20 support instead. You can also try the latest code name (e.g. -std=c++2c) for experimental support for features from the upcoming language standard.Setting a language standard in GCC/G++/Clang
