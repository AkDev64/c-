# Strings

  Strings in C++ are objects of the std::string class. They are used to represent and manipulate sequences of characters.
  Unlike C-style character arrays (char[]), std::string handles memory management automatically and provides a wide range of built-in functions for ease of use.
  Can automatically grow and shrink as you add or remove characters, unlike fixed-size C-style strings.
  You can easily access characters, join strings, compare them, extract substrings, and search within strings using built-in functions.
